# CVE-2020-0796

An even more simple PoC and Scanner for CVE-2020-0796, as it uses static packets. There is a protection to prevent accidental usage on public IPs (don't do that) and an on/off switch to flick crashing. Only requires vanilla Python 3!

Scan mode:
```
python3 poc-and-scan.py 10.0.0.15 N
```

Scan+Crash mode:
```
python3 poc-and-scan.py 10.0.0.15 Y
```

Output:
```
SMB v311 with LZNT1 detected.
Sending malformed packet per user request!
```
